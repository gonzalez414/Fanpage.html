      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Junior H (Antonio Herrera Perez) was born in Guanajuato in central
        Mexico in 2002. Deeply interested in music from a very young age, he
        grew up with traditional music and hip-hop on the radio. At 12, he and a
        friend began writing song lyrics because neither could play an
        instrument, though he spent time at local studios and learned how to
        record music. At 15, after three years of learning and practicing the
        art of music, Junior had to start from scratch when his family moved to
        Utah. He taught himself to play guitar by watching YouTube videos. The
        lack of proper training has benefitted the songwriter in developing a
        truly unique playing style.
